== Part 1: Getting Started

=== What is Rez?

Rez is a language for creating choice-based HTML games/interactive fiction.

If you have ever wanted to build choice-based games with inventories, smart NPCs, and complex mechanics without fighting your tools, Rez may be for you.

Think of it as a powerful alternative to https://twinery.org/[Twine]. While Twine democratized interactive fiction creation and remains excellent for narrative-focused projects, more complex games push the limits and need a tool designed to support that complexity. This is where Rez comes into its own.

Rez uses an easy-to-learn declarative syntax and only requires Javascript for advanced features.

It makes it easy to build:

* **Rich NPCs** with memory, behavior trees, and complex interactions
* **Dynamic inventories** where a ring works differently on your hand vs in your backpack
* **Flexible layouts** that adapt to different game requirements (combat, dialogue, exploration)
* **Procedural content** that creates unique experiences on each playthrough
* **New mechanics** that we didn't think of

Rez sits between the simplicity of Twine and the complexity of parser-based systems like https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/[Inform] while offering many of the benefits of both.

==== A Simple Example

Here's a taste of what Rez code looks like:

....
@card greeting {
  visit_count: 0
  content: ```
  <p>Hello! This is visit number ${card.visit_count}.</p>
  <p><a card="greeting">Visit again</a></p>
  ```
  on_start: (card) => {
    card.visit_count += 1;
  }
}
....

This creates an interactive card that tracks how many times it's been visited.

This tiny example demonstrates Rez's core philosophy: clean separation between what the players see and what happens behind the scenes. Scale this approach up and you can build any choice-based game you can imagine.

=== Installation and Setup

To get started with Rez, you'll need to have Rez installed on your system.

[NOTE]
====
Installation instructions depend on your platform. Please refer to the main Rez documentation for current installation methods.
====

Once installed, you can create a new game project with:

....
rez new my_first_game --author-name="Your Name" --author-email="you@example.com" --game-title="My First Game"
....

This creates a folder called `my_first_game` with the following structure:

....
my-first-game/
├── src/
│   └── my-first-game.rez    # Your game source code
├── lib/
│   └── stdlib.rez           # Rez standard library (don't modify)
├── assets/                  # Images, sounds, etc.
└── dist/                    # Compiled game files (created on build)
....

=== Your First Game

Let's create a simple but complete game to understand the basics. Open `src/my-first-game.rez` and replace everything from `@game` onwards with:

....
@game {
  name: "treasure_hunt"
  title: "Treasure Hunt"
  author_name: "Matt Mower"
  author_email: "self@mattmower.com"
  game_homepage: "http://mattmower.com/"

  IFID: "12345678-1234-5678-9ABC-123456789ABC"
  archive_format: 1

  version: 1.0
  created: "2025-07-20 14:01:27.161254Z"

  initial_scene_id: #opening_scene
  layout: ```
  <section class="main-content is-fullheight">
    <section class="hero">
      <div class="hero-body">
        <p class="title">${game.title}</p>
        <p class="sub_title">a game by <a href="${game.game_homepage}">${game.author_name}</a></p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <div class="container">
      ${content}
    </div>
  </section>
  ```
}

@scene opening_scene {
  initial_card_id: #forest_entrance
}

@card forest_entrance {
  content: ```
  <p>You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A weathered sign reads "TREASURE WITHIN".</p>
  <p>What do you want to do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a card="enter_forest">Enter the forest</a></li>
    <li><a card="examine_sign">Examine the sign more closely</a></li>
  </ul>
  ```
}

@card enter_forest {
  content: ```
  <p>You push through the undergrowth and find yourself in a small clearing.
  In the center sits an old wooden chest!</p>
  <p><a card="open_chest">Open the chest</a></p>
  <p><a card="forest_entrance">Go back to the entrance</a></p>
  ```
}

@card examine_sign {
  content: ```
  <p>Looking closer at the sign, you notice small text at the bottom:
  "Beware the guardian of the treasure."</p>
  <p><a card="forest_entrance">Return to the entrance</a></p>
  ```
}

@card open_chest {
  bindings: [player: #player]
  content: ```
  $if(player.has_key) -> {%
    <p>Using the key, you open the chest and find a pile of gold coins!
    You win!</p>
    <p><a card="forest_entrance">Play again</a></p>
  %}
  () -> {%
    <p>The chest is locked tight. You need a key.</p>
    <p><a card="search_area">Search the area for a key</a></p>
    <p><a card="enter_forest">Go back</a></p>
  %}
  ```
}

@card search_area {
  content: ```
  <p>You search around the clearing and find a rusty key hidden under some leaves!</p>
  <p><a card="open_chest">Try the key on the chest</a></p>
  ```
  on_start: (card) => {
    $player.has_key = true;
  }
}

@actor player {
  $global: true
  has_key: false
}
....

[NOTE]
====
Notice the `$global: true` attribute on the player. This makes the player object accessible globally using `$player` in JavaScript code, which is why we can use `$player.has_key = true`.
====

=== Compiling and Running the Game

From the `my_first_game` folder run:

....
➜ rc compile src/my_first_game.rez
rez v1.8.1 — compiled to dist folder
....

Then open the dist/index.html file. There's a version https://rez-lang.com/games/my_first_game/index.html[online] and it should look like:

image::index.png[]

=== Distributing Your Game

Package the contents of the `dist` folder in any way you like.

=== Understanding the Structure

Let's break down what we just created:

**@game**: The top-level container that defines the game's metadata and overall layout. Every Rez game needs exactly one `@game`` element and it always has the id `#game`. It must also have an attribute `initial_scene_id` that refers to the scene that starts the game.

**@scene**: A context where interactions take place, can have a layout (for example a dialogue scene might use a different layout to an inventory scene). Each scene has an `initial_card_id` that defines which `@card`` gets presented first when that scene starts. You can have one scene or many scenes.

**@card**: The content that players mostly see and interact with. Cards contain the text, choices, and behaviors that make up your game. It must have a `content:` attribute containing a template that determines what the player will be shown.

The structure flows like this:
....
@game layout
  └── @scene layout
      └── @card content
....

=== Compilation and Testing

To build your game, run:

....
rez compile src/my-first-game.rez
....

This creates the compiled game in the `dist/` folder. Open `dist/index.html` in a web browser to play your game.

The compilation process:

1. Reads your `.rez` source files
2. Converts them to JavaScript objects
3. Creates an HTML page with embedded JavaScript
4. Copies any assets to the distribution folder

=== Next Steps

Now that you have a working game, you can:

* Add more cards and scenes to expand the story
* Include images and other assets
* Add dynamic behavior with JavaScript
* Experiment with different layout modes

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into the core concepts that make Rez games work.

== Part 2: Core Concepts

=== Understanding Elements

Rez games are built from **elements** - the building blocks that define everything in your game. Elements represent things like the game itself, scenes, cards, characters, items, and more.

Every element follows the same basic pattern:

....
@element_type unique_id {
  attribute_name: value
  another_attribute: another_value
}
....

For example:
....
@card magic_sword {
  name: "Enchanted Blade"
  damage: 15
  magic: true
}
....

==== The Three Essential Elements

Every Rez game uses three core elements:

**@game** - The overall game container that holds game metadata and the "master" layout
....
@game {
  name: "adventure"
  title: "Sandbags Mythical Adventure"
  initial_scene_id: #opening
  author: "Matt Mower"
  author_email: "self@mattmower.com"
  layout: ```
    <section class="hero">
      <div class="hero-body">
        <p class="title">${game.title}</p>
        <p class="subtitle">By ${game.author}</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    ${content}
  ```
}
....

**@scene** - A context for a kind of player interaction that can have its own layout
....
@scene opening {
  initial_card_id: #start_here
  layout: ```
    <div class="columns-2">
      <div class="column">${sidebar}</div>
      <div class="column">${content}</div>
    </div>
  ```
}
....

**@card** - Content that players see and interact with
....
@card start_here {
  content: ```
  <p>Your adventure begins...</p>
  <p><a card="next_card">Continue</a></p>
  ```
}
....

==== Element IDs

Every element needs a unique ID that follows JavaScript naming rules:

* Start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
* Can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs
* Cannot contain spaces or special characters
* Are case-sensitive

Good IDs: `forest_entrance`, `magic_sword`, `npc_wizard`, `scene1`

Bad IDs: `forest entrance`, `magic-sword`, `123start`, `npc@wizard`

=== Understanding Attributes

Attributes are how you describe an element's properties and behavior. They use the format `name: value` with a required space after the colon.

....
@card treasure_room {
  title: "The Treasure Chamber"      // String
  visited: false                     // Boolean
  gold_count: 100                    // Number
  room_type: :treasure               // Keyword (symbol)
  owner_id: #dragon                  // Element reference
  content: ```                       // Template (multi-line string)
  <p>A room filled with gold!</p>
  ```
  on_enter: (card) => {              // Event script function
    card.visited = true;
  }
  refill_gold: function() {          // Action script function
    this.gold_count = 100;
  }
}
....

==== Attribute Types

**Strings** - Text enclosed in double quotes
....
description: "A rusty old key"
....

**Numbers** - Integers or decimals
....
damage: 15
weight: 2.5
price: -10
....

**Booleans** - True or false values
....
magic: true
cursed: false
found: yes      // yes/no also work
hidden: no
....

**Keywords** - Symbols starting with a colon, useful for categories
....
material: :gold
rarity: :legendary
type: :weapon
....

**Element References** - Point to another elements by referencing it's id #
....
owner_id: #player
location_id: #forest
wielded_by_id: #hero
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
**The `_id` Suffix Convention**: Any attribute ending with `_id` gets special treatment. Rez automatically creates a paired property without the suffix that points to the actual object:

....
@scene forest {
  initial_card_id: #entrance    // You define this
  // Rez automatically creates:
  // initial_card -> the actual RezCard object
}

@actor hero {
  location_id: #forest         // You define this
  // Rez automatically creates:
  // location -> reference to the object with ID #forest
}
....

This means you can use both `hero.location_id` (the string ID) and `hero.location` (the actual object). If you assign a new object to `hero.location` it will update `hero.location_id` to the right ID value.
====

**Templates** - Multi-line content with dynamic expressions
....
content: ```
<p>Welcome, ${player.name}!</p>
<p>You have ${player.gold} gold coins.</p>
```
....

**Lists** - Collections of values (space-separated, no commas)
....
colors: [:red :green :blue]
numbers: [1 2 3 4 5]
names: ["Alice" "Bob" "Charlie"]
items: [#sword #shield #potion]
....

**Event Scripts** - JavaScript functions for handling events
....
on_use: (item) => {
  player.health += 10;
  return RezEvent.playCard("feeling_better");
}
....

Event script functions are written as arrow functions and passed the event
receiving object as their first parameter.

**Action Script** - Javascript functions for performing behaviours
....
use: function() {
  this.uses -= 1;
}
....

Action script functions are written in the standard Javascript function format
and utilise `this` as a reference to the object whose action script is being
executed.

[TIP]
====
**Event Response Methods**: Event scripts must use RezEvent to specify what happens as a result of the event:

* `RezEvent.playCard("card_id")` - Play a new card in the current scene
* `RezEvent.switchScene("scene_id")` - Start a new scene
* `RezEvent.flash("message")` - Show a flash message to the player
* `RezEvent.render()` - Re-render the current view
* `RezEvent.noop()` - do nothing

Methods can be chained: `RezEvent.playCard("victory").flash("You won!")`
====

=== Dynamic Properties

Dynamic properties are attributes that calculate their value each time they're accessed, rather than storing a fixed value. They're perfect for derived stats, percentages, and values that depend on other attributes.

==== Basic Dynamic Properties

Use `^p{...}` to define a property that recalculates automatically:

....
@actor hero {
  first_name: "Sir"
  last_name: "Galahad"

  // This calculates every time it's accessed
  full_name: ^p{
    return `${this.first_name} ${this.last_name}`;
  }

  health: 85
  max_health: 100

  // Perfect for UI elements like health bars
  health_percentage: ^p{
    return this.health * 100 / this.max_health;
  }

  // Boolean states based on other attributes
  is_healthy: ^p{
    return this.health > this.max_health * 0.5;
  }

  is_at_full_health: ^p{
    return this.health >= this.max_health;
  }
}
....

==== Practical Examples

Dynamic properties shine for calculated stats:

....
@actor character {
  strength: 15
  dexterity: 12
  intelligence: 14

  // Calculated modifier (D&D style)
  strength_modifier: ^p{
    return Math.floor((this.strength - 10) / 2);
  }

  // Total of all stats
  total_stats: ^p{
    return this.strength + this.dexterity + this.intelligence;
  }

  // Armor class calculation
  base_armor: 10
  armor_bonus: 2
  armor_class: ^p{
    return this.base_armor + this.dex_modifier + this.armor_bonus;
  }
}
....

For inventory and resource management:

....
@actor player {
  gold: 150
  silver: 75
  copper: 200

  // Total wealth in copper pieces
  total_wealth: ^p{
    return this.copper + (this.silver * 10) + (this.gold * 100);
  }

  current_weight: 45
  max_carrying_capacity: 100

  // How much more can be carried
  carrying_capacity_remaining: ^p{
    return Math.max(0, this.max_carrying_capacity - this.current_weight);
  }

  // Whether player is overloaded
  is_encumbered: ^p{
    return this.current_weight > this.max_carrying_capacity;
  }
}
....

==== When Properties Recalculate

Dynamic properties recalculate every time they're accessed. This means:

* When displayed in templates: `${player.health_percentage}`
* When used in conditions: `$if(player.is_healthy)`
* When accessed in JavaScript: `player.total_stats`

The calculation runs fresh each time, so changes to underlying attributes automatically update derived values.

[TIP]
====
Dynamic properties are ideal for:

* **UI displays** - health bars, progress indicators, status text
* **Calculated stats** - armor class, damage bonuses, skill totals
* **Boolean states** - is_alive, can_afford, has_space
* **Formatted text** - full names, descriptions with variables

Avoid using them for expensive calculations that don't change often - use regular attributes for those.
====

=== Basic Content and Templates

The `content` attribute is where you define what players actually see. It uses templates that can include both static text and dynamic expressions.

==== Static Content

Simple text and HTML:
....
@card welcome {
  content: ```
  <h2>Welcome to the Adventure!</h2>
  <p>You are standing in a medieval village square.</p>
  ```
}
....

==== Dynamic Content with Expressions

Use `${...}` to include dynamic values:
....
@card status {
  content: ```
  <h3>Character Status</h3>
  <p>Name: ${player.name}</p>
  <p>Level: ${player.level}</p>
  <p>Health: ${player.health}/${player.max_health}</p>
  ```
}
....

Note that expressions cannot be arbitrary pieces of Javascript so `${player.level + 1}` while it will compile, is not a valid expression.

The `player` reference comes from **bindings** - you tell Rez which game objects to make available in templates:

....
@card status {
  bindings: [player: #main_character]
  content: ```
  <p>Name: ${player.name}</p>
  ```
}
....

Bindings flow down so that any binding made in the `@game` is available in the current `@scene` or `@card`, likewise bindings in the `@scene` are available in the current card.

==== Default Bindings

Some bindings are always available:

* `card` - The current card being displayed
* `scene` - The current scene
* `game` - The game object

....
@card example {
  visit_count: 0
  content: ```
  <p>This card has been visited ${card.visit_count} times.</p>
  ```
}
....

=== Navigation Between Cards

Rez provides several ways to move between cards and scenes:

==== Playing a Card

Use `<a card="card_id">` to switch to another card in the same scene:
....
<a card="forest_clearing">Enter the forest</a>
....

==== Switching Scenes

Use `<a scene="scene_id">` to start a new scene:
....
<a scene="dungeon_entrance">Enter the dungeon</a>
....

==== Scene Interludes

Use `<a interlude="scene_id>` and `<a resume>` to run a scene interlude.

Sometimes mid-scene we find a need to go to another scene temporarily. This is very common for things like NPC conversation or combat, shops/trading or inventory management, presenting history or other details, or for mini-games.

Using an interlude we 'put a bookmark' in the current scene, switch another scene, and then use the bookmark to find our place in the original scene and continue where we left off.

....
<a interlude="conversation">Talk to the Hermit</a>
....

When the user clicks an `<a resume>` link the interlude scene goes away and the original scene is resumed from the point where the player left it.

==== Event Links

Trigger custom behavior with `<a event="event_name">`:
....
@card magic_door {
  locked: true
  content: ```
  <p>A mysterious door blocks your path.</p>
  $if(card.locked) {%
    <a event="try_key">Try to unlock with the key</a>
  %}, {%
    <a card="beyond_door">Go through the door</a>
  %}
  ```
  on_try_key: (card) => {
    if(player.has_item("magic_key")) {
      card.locked = false;
      return RezEvent.flash("The key works! The door swings open.");
    } else {
      return RezEvent.flash("You don't have the right key.");
    }
  }
}
....

[TIP]
====
A big part of keeping your game managable is making good decisions about where to store
the different properties that describe the 'world model'.

Sometimes it is okay to put it in the nearest card but in different situations it might
be more appropriate to put it elsewhere. Obvious places are the player (if you have one)
or the game. However both of these can end up "stuffed" with properties relating to the
world or puzzles you are setting up for the player. Sometimes you can ameliorate this
with comments but often the answer is to find a better place.

For example you might think about using a `@plot` element, or use Rez's ability to create
custom `@object`s.

....
@object magic_door {
  locked: true
  description: "mysterious door"
}
....

If there were multiple ways that this door could be unlocked then having it contained in
its own object could make a lot of sense and be much easier to understand later on.
====

==== Buttons

You can also use buttons instead of links:
....
<button card="next_scene">Continue Adventure</button>
<button event="cast_spell">Cast Fireball</button>
....

==== Custom Components

Rez allows you to create reusable HTML components using `@component`. Components are JavaScript functions that return formatted HTML and can accept parameters, making them perfect for complex UI elements that you use repeatedly.

**Basic Component Syntax**

....
@component component_name (bindings, assigns, content) => {
  // JavaScript code that returns HTML string
  return `<div>Custom HTML here</div>`;
}
....

**Simple Self-Closing Component**

....
@component health_bar (bindings, assigns, content) => {
  const current = assigns.current || 0;
  const max = assigns.max || 100;
  const percentage = Math.round((current / max) * 100);

  return `
    <div class="health-bar">
      <div class="health-fill" style="width: ${percentage}%"></div>
      <span class="health-text">${current}/${max}</span>
    </div>
  `;
}
....

Use it in templates with dot notation as a self-closing tag:

....
content: ```
<.health_bar current="${player.health}" max="${player.max_health}" />
```
....

**Container Component with Content**

Components can also wrap content like regular HTML tags:

....
@component info_panel (bindings, assigns, content) => {
  const title = assigns.title || "Information";
  const type = assigns.type || "default";

  return `
    <div class="info-panel info-panel--${type}">
      <h3 class="info-panel__title">${title}</h3>
      <div class="info-panel__content">
        ${content}
      </div>
    </div>
  `;
}
....

Use it as a container with dot notation:

....
content: ```
<.info_panel title="Combat Status" type="warning">
  <p>You are in combat with ${enemy.name}!</p>
  <p>Your health: ${player.health}</p>
</.info_panel>
```
....

**Advanced Component with Logic**

Components can include complex logic and conditionals:

....
@component inventory_slot (bindings, assigns, content) => {
  const item = assigns.item;
  const index = assigns.index;
  const isEmpty = !item;

  if (isEmpty) {
    return `
      <div class="inventory-slot inventory-slot--empty" data-slot="${index}">
        <div class="slot-placeholder">Empty</div>
      </div>
    `;
  }

  const rarity = item.rarity || "common";
  const quantity = item.quantity > 1 ? `<span class="quantity">${item.quantity}</span>` : "";

  return `
    <div class="inventory-slot inventory-slot--${rarity}" data-slot="${index}">
      <img src="${item.icon}" alt="${item.name}" class="item-icon">
      <div class="item-name">${item.name}</div>
      ${quantity}
      <div class="item-tooltip" data-tooltip="${item.description}"></div>
    </div>
  `;
}
....

**Component Parameters**

Components receive three parameters:

* **`bindings`** - All bindings available in the current context (player, scene, etc.)
* **`assigns`** - Attributes passed to the component via HTML attributes
* **`content`** - HTML content between opening and closing tags (for container components)

**When to Use Components**

Components are ideal for:

* **Repeated UI patterns** - health bars, inventory slots, dialog boxes
* **Complex widgets** - skill trees, character sheets, mini-maps
* **Conditional rendering** - different layouts based on game state
* **Dynamic content** - procedurally generated elements
* **Reusable game mechanics** - card displays, battle interfaces

[TIP]
====
Keep components focused on presentation logic. For game logic, use element methods and events instead. Components should transform data into HTML, not modify game state.

=== A Complete Example

Let's build a simple character creation scene:

....
@scene character_creation {
  initial_card_id: #choose_name
  layout: ```
  <div class="creation-scene">
    <h2>Create Your Character</h2>
    ${content}
  </div>
  ```
}

@card choose_name {
  content: ```
  <p>What is your character's name?</p>
  <input type="text" rez-bind="player.name" placeholder="Enter name">
  <p><button card="choose_class">Next: Choose Class</button></p>
  ```
}

@card choose_class {
  bindings: [player: #player]
  content: ```
  <p>Hello, ${player.name}! Choose your class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a event="choose_warrior">Warrior (Strong and tough)</a></li>
    <li><a event="choose_mage">Mage (Wise and magical)</a></li>
    <li><a event="choose_thief">Thief (Quick and sneaky)</a></li>
  </ul>
  ```
  on_choose_warrior: (card) => {
    player.class = "warrior";
    player.strength = 15;
    player.sneak = 5;
    player.magic = 5;
    return RezEvent.playCard("creation_complete");
  }
  on_choose_mage: (card) => {
    player.class = "mage";
    player.strength = 5;
    player.sneak = 5;
    player.magic = 15;
    return RezEvent.playCard("creation_complete");
  }
  on_choose_thief: (card) => {
    player.class = "thief";
    player.strength = 5;
    player.sneak = 15;
    player.magic = 5;
    return RezEvent.playCard("creation_complete");
  }
}

@card creation_complete {
  bindings: [player: #player]
  content: ```
  <h3>Character Created!</h3>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${player.name}</p>
  <p><strong>Class:</strong> ${player.class}</p>
  <p><strong>Strength:</strong> ${player.strength}</p>
  <p><strong>Magic:</strong> ${player.magic}</p>
  <p><button scene="game_start">Begin Adventure!</button></p>
  ```
}

@actor player {
  $global: true
  name: ""
  class: ""
  strength: 5
  magic: 5
  sneak: 5
}
....

This example demonstrates:

* Multiple cards working together
* Form input with `rez-bind`
* Event handlers that modify game state
* Dynamic content based on character attributes
* Navigation between cards and scenes

== Part 3: Building Interactive Content

=== Advanced Templating

Rez templates support more than just simple variable substitution. You can create dynamic content that responds to game state, user choices, and changing conditions.

==== Conditional Content

Use `$if()` expressions to show content based on conditions:

....
@card tavern {
  bindings: [player: #hero]
  content: ```
  <h3>The Rusty Dragon Tavern</h3>

  $if(player.gold >= 10) -> {%
    <p>You have enough gold for a meal and room.</p>
    <button event="buy_room">Rent a room (10 gold)</button>
  %}
  () -> {%
    <p>You're too poor to afford a room here.</p>
    <button event="work_for_gold">Offer to work for gold</button>
  %}

  $if(player.level >= 5) -> {%
    <p>The bartender nods respectfully at such an experienced adventurer.</p>
  %}
  ```
}
....

You can chain conditions:
....
$if(player.health <= 0) -> {%
  <p>You have died!</p>
%}
(player.health < 20) -> {%
  <p>You are badly wounded.</p>
%}
() -> {%
  <p>You feel healthy and strong.</p>
%}
....

==== Iterating Over Collections

Use `$foreach()` to loop through lists or arrays:

....
@card inventory {
  bindings: [
    player: #hero,
    items: () => $("hero").inventory.items
  ]
  content: ```
  <h3>Your Inventory</h3>

  $if(items.length > 0) {%
    <ul>
    $foreach(item: items) {%
      <li>${item.name} - ${item.description}</li>
    %}
    </ul>
  %}, {%
    <p>Your inventory is empty.</p>
  %}
  ```
}
....

With separators between items:
....
$foreach(skill: player.skills) {%
  ${skill.name}: Level ${skill.level}
%}, {%
  <br>
%}
....

==== Advanced Bindings

Bindings make data available to your templates. You can create different types of bindings:

**Element Bindings** - Reference game objects:
....
bindings: [
  player: #main_character,
  location: #current_room,
  villain: #dark_lord
]
....

**Function Bindings** - Calculate values dynamically:
....
bindings: [
  total_score: () => {return player.experience + player.gold},
  random_event: () => {return Math.random() < 0.3},
  available_exits: () => {return current_location.getExits()}
]
....

**Attribute Bindings** - Direct access to specific attributes:
....
bindings: [
  player_name: &player.name,
  current_health: &player.health
]
....

=== Forms and User Input

Rez makes it easy to capture user input through HTML forms with two-way data binding.

==== Text Input

Bind text inputs directly to object attributes:
....
@card character_setup {
  bindings: [player: #player]
  content: ```
  <h3>Character Setup</h3>

  <label>Character Name:</label>
  <input type="text" rez-bind="player.name" placeholder="Enter your name">

  <label>Background Story:</label>
  <textarea rez-bind="player.background" rows="4"></textarea>

  <button card="choose_stats">Continue</button>
  ```
}
....

==== Checkboxes and Choices

Use checkboxes for boolean values:
....
@card preferences {
  bindings: [settings: #game_settings]
  content: ```
  <h3>Game Preferences</h3>

  <label>
    <input type="checkbox" rez-bind="settings.sound_enabled">
    Enable Sound Effects
  </label>

  <label>
    <input type="checkbox" rez-bind="settings.difficulty_hard">
    Hard Difficulty Mode
  </label>
  ```
}
....

Radio buttons for exclusive choices:
....
<h4>Choose your weapon:</h4>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="weapon" value="sword" rez-bind="player.starting_weapon">
  Sword (+3 Attack)
</label>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="weapon" value="bow" rez-bind="player.starting_weapon">
  Bow (+2 Attack, +1 Range)
</label>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="weapon" value="staff" rez-bind="player.starting_weapon">
  Staff (+1 Attack, +2 Magic)
</label>
....

==== Select Dropdowns

For choosing from many options:
....
<label>Starting Location:</label>
<select rez-bind="player.hometown">
  <option value="village">Peaceful Village</option>
  <option value="city">Bustling City</option>
  <option value="forest">Forest Dwelling</option>
  <option value="mountain">Mountain Keep</option>
</select>
....

==== Event-Driven Forms

Use `rez-live` to trigger events when form values change:
....
@card dynamic_stats {
  content: ```
  <h3>Allocate Stat Points</h3>
  <p>Points remaining: ${card.points_remaining}</p>

  <label>Strength:
    <input type="range" min="1" max="20" rez-bind="player.strength" rez-live>
  </label>

  <label>Intelligence:
    <input type="range" min="1" max="20" rez-bind="player.intelligence" rez-live>
  </label>
  ```

  points_remaining: 20

  on_input: (card, event) => {
    const total = player.strength + player.intelligence;
    card.points_remaining = 20 - total;
    return RezEvent.render();
  }
}
....

=== Assets and Media

Add images, audio, and other media to your games using the asset system.

==== Defining Assets

Create asset elements to register your media files:
....
@asset hero_portrait {
  file: "characters/hero.png"
  width: 150
  height: 200
}

@asset background_music {
  file: "audio/tavern_theme.mp3"
}

@asset treasure_sound {
  file: "audio/treasure_found.wav"
}
....

==== Using Images

Display images in your content:
....
@card character_sheet {
  content: ```
  <h3>Character Information</h3>
  <div class="character-display">
    <.img name="hero_portrait" class="character-image" />
    <div class="character-stats">
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${player.name}</p>
      <p><strong>Level:</strong> ${player.level}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
}
....

Or build your own image tags:
....
<img src='${"hero_portrait" | asset_path}' alt="Hero Portrait" class="portrait">
....

==== Dynamic Assets

Choose different assets based on game state:
....
@card location_view {
  bindings: [
    location_image: () => {
      if (player.location === "forest") return "forest_scene";
      if (player.location === "dungeon") return "dungeon_scene";
      return "default_scene";
    }
  ]
  content: ```
  <div class="location-display">
    <img src='${location_image | asset_path}' alt="Current Location">
    <p>${location.description}</p>
  </div>
  ```
}
....

==== Audio Integration

While audio isn't fully integrated yet, you can add it manually:
....
@card victory {
  content: ```
  <h2>Victory!</h2>
  <p>You have defeated the dragon and claimed the treasure!</p>
  <audio autoplay>
    <source src='${"victory_music" | asset_path}' type="audio/mpeg">
  </audio>
  ```
}
....

=== Building a Complete Interactive Scene

Let's create a combat system that demonstrates advanced templating and dynamic content:

....
@scene combat {
  initial_card_id: #combat_start
  enemy_id: #goblin
  bindings: [
    player: #player
    enemy: scene.enemy
  ]
  layout: ```
  <div class="combat-scene">
    <h2>Combat!</h2>
    ${content}
  </div>
  ```
}

@card combat_start {
  content: ```
  <div class="combat-status">
    <div class="combatant">
      <h4>${player.name}</h4>
      <div class="health-bar">
        <div class="health-fill" style="width: ${player.health_perc}%"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Health: ${player.health}/${player.max_health}</p>
    </div>

    <div class="vs">VS</div>

    <div class="combatant">
      <h4>${enemy.name}</h4>
      <div class="health-bar">
        <div class="health-fill" style="width: ${enemy.health_perc}%"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Health: ${enemy.health}/${enemy.max_health}</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="combat-actions">
    <h4>Choose your action:</h4>
    <button event="attack">Attack (${player.attack_power} damage)</button>
    <button event="defend">Defend (+${player.defense_bonus} defense)</button>
    $if(player.mana >= 10) {%
      <button event="cast_spell">Cast Fireball (10 mana)</button>
    %}
    <button event="try_flee">Attempt to Flee</button>
  </div>
  ```

  on_attack: (card) => {
    const enemy = card.scene.enemy;

    const damage = Math.max(1, $player.attack_power - enemy.defense);
    enemy.health -= damage;

    if (enemy.health <= 0) {
      return RezEvent.playCard("victory");
    } else {
      return RezEvent.playCard("enemy_turn").flash(`You deal ${damage} damage!`);
    }
  }

  on_defend: (card) => {
    $player.temp_defense = $player.defense_bonus;
    return RezEvent.playCard("enemy_turn").flash("You prepare to defend!");
  }

  on_cast_spell: (card) => {
    const enemy = card.scene.enemy;

    $player.mana -= 10;
    const damage = 15;
    enemy.health -= damage;

    if(enemy.health <= 0) {
      return RezEvent.playCard("victory");
    } else {
      return RezEvent.playCard("enemy_turn").flash(`Your fireball deals ${damage} damage!`);
    }
  }

  on_try_flee: (card) => {
    const flee_ability = 0.5 * (($player.sneak - 7.5) / 7.5);
    const flee_chance = 0.5 + flee_ability;
    if (Math.random() < flee_chance) {
      return RezEvent.switchScene("overworld").flash("You successfully escape!");
    } else {
      $player.temp_defence = -5;
      return RezEvent.playCard("enemy_turn").flash("You couldn't escape!");
    }
  }
}

@card enemy_turn {
  content: ```
  <p>${enemy.name} attacks!</p>
  <button event="continue">Continue</button>
  ```

  on_continue: (card) => {
    const enemy = card.scene.enemy;

    const damage = Math.max(1, enemy.attack_power - ($player.defense + ($player.temp_defense || 0)));
    player.health -= damage;
    player.temp_defense = 0; // Reset temporary defense

    if (player.health <= 0) {
      return RezEvent.playCard("defeat");
    } else {
      return RezEvent.playCard("combat_start").flash(`${enemy.name} deals ${damage} damage to you!`);
    }
  }
}

@card victory {
  content: ```
  <h3>Victory!</h3>
  <p>You have defeated the ${enemy.name}!</p>
  <p>You gain ${enemy.experience_reward} experience and ${enemy.gold_reward} gold.</p>
  <button scene="overworld">Continue your adventure</button>
  ```

  on_start: (card) => {
    const enemy = card.scene.enemy;
    player.experience += enemy.experience_reward;
    player.gold += enemy.gold_reward;
  }
}

@actor player {
  $global: true
  name: "Hero"
  health: 100
  max_health: 100
  health_perc: ^p{
    return this.health * 100 / this.max_health;
  }
  mana: 50
  attack_power: 15
  defense: 5
  defense_bonus: 3
  experience: 0
  gold: 0
}

@actor goblin {
  $global: true
  name: "Goblin"
  health: 30
  max_health: 30
  health_perc: ^p{
    return this.health * 100 / this.max_health;
  }
  attack_power: 8
  defense: 2
  experience_reward: 25
  gold_reward: 10
}
....

This combat system demonstrates:

* Dynamic health bars using CSS and template expressions
* Conditional action availability based on resources (mana)
* Bindings flowing down from scene to card
* Dynamic properties
* Event-driven gameplay with multiple outcomes
* State management across multiple cards
* Visual feedback through flash messages

== Part 4: Advanced Features

=== Custom Elements and Mixins

As your games grow more complex, you'll want to create your own element types and reusable components.

==== Creating Custom Elements

Use `@elem` to define new element types based on existing ones:

....
@elem npc = actor

@npc village_guard {
  name: "Guard"
  occupation: "Village Protector"
  dialogue: "Halt! State your business."
}
....

This creates a new `@npc` element type that inherits all the properties of `@actor` but can have its own defaults and behaviors.

==== Adding Default Attributes

Use `@defaults` to give custom elements standard attributes:

....
@elem monster = actor

@defaults monster {
  hostile: true
  experience_reward: 10
  gold_reward: 5
  behavior_pattern: :aggressive
}

@monster goblin {
  name: "Goblin Warrior"
  health: 25
  attack_power: 8
  // Inherits: hostile: true, experience_reward: 10, etc.
}
....

==== Mixins for Shared Behavior

Mixins let you share common attributes across different element types:

....
@mixin combat_capable {
  health: 100
  max_health: 100
  attack_power: 10
  defense: 5

  take_damage: function(amount) {
    this.health = Math.max(0, this.health - amount);
    return this.health <= 0;
  }

  heal: function(amount) {
    this.health = Math.min(this.max_health, this.health + amount);
  }
}

@elem warrior = actor<#combat_capable>
@elem guardian = actor<#combat_capable>

@warrior player_character {
  name: "Hero"
  // Automatically gets all combat_capable attributes and methods
}
....

Multiple mixins can be combined:
....
@mixin magic_user {
  mana: 50
  max_mana: 50
  spell_power: 12
}

@elem battle_mage = actor<#combat_capable, #magic_user>
....

=== Behavior Trees

For complex NPC AI and game logic, Rez includes a powerful behavior tree system. Behavior trees let you create sophisticated, reactive AI without writing complex JavaScript.

==== Basic Behavior Tree Concepts

Behavior trees are composed of nodes that either succeed or fail:

* **Composite nodes** coordinate multiple child behaviors
* **Condition nodes** test the game state
* **Action nodes** modify the game state

....
@actor smart_guard {
  name: "Intelligent Guard"

  behaviors: ^[
    $select
      [$sequence
        [player_nearby range=3]
        [guard_not_alerted]
        [set_alert_level level=1]]
      [$sequence
        [alert_level_equals level=2]
        [call_for_backup]]
      [patrol_route]
  ]
}
....

==== Core Behavior Types

**$select** - Try children until one succeeds (OR logic):
....
behaviors: ^[
  $select
    [has_weapon]      // Try this first
    [find_weapon]     // If no weapon, try to find one
    [flee_combat]     // Last resort: run away
]
....

**$sequence** - All children must succeed (AND logic):
....
behaviors: ^[
  $sequence
    [see_enemy]       // First, spot an enemy
    [weapon_ready]    // Then, make sure weapon is ready
    [attack_enemy]    // Finally, attack
]
....

**$parallel** - Run multiple behaviors simultaneously:
....
behaviors: ^[
  $parallel
    [patrol_area]     // Keep patrolling
    [watch_for_threats] // While watching for danger
]
....

==== Writing Custom Behaviors

Create your own condition and action behaviors:

....
@behaviour player_nearby {
  options: ["range"]
  execute: function(owner, behaviour, wmem) {
    const range = behaviour.option("range");
    const distance = owner.distanceTo($("player"));

    return {
      success: distance <= range,
      wmem: wmem
    };
  }
}

@behaviour set_alert_level {
  options: ["level"]
  execute: function(owner, behaviour, wmem) {
    const level = behaviour.option("level");
    owner.alert_level = level;

    return {
      success: true,
      wmem: wmem
    };
  }
}
....

==== Complex AI Example

Here's a sophisticated NPC that reacts to the player and environment:

....
@actor tavern_keeper {
  name: "Bartender Bob"
  mood: :neutral
  reputation_with_player: 0
  last_interaction: 0

  behaviors: ^[
    $select
      // Emergency responses
      [$sequence
        [tavern_on_fire]
        [evacuate_tavern]]

      // Player interactions
      [$sequence
        [player_at_bar]
        [$select
          [$sequence
            [player_reputation_high]
            [greet_warmly]]
          [$sequence
            [player_reputation_low]
            [greet_coldly]]
          [greet_neutrally]]]

      // Idle behaviors
      [$sequence
        [no_customers_present]
        [$select
          [clean_glasses]
          [restock_bottles]
          [count_money]]]

      // Default: serve customers
      [serve_random_customer]
  ]
}

@behaviour player_at_bar {
  execute: function(owner, behaviour, wmem) {
    const player_location = $("player").current_location;
    return {
      success: player_location === "tavern_bar",
      wmem: wmem
    };
  }
}

@behaviour greet_warmly {
  execute: function(owner, behaviour, wmem) {
    const greetings = [
      "Welcome back, friend! The usual?",
      "Good to see you again! What can I get you?",
      "My favorite customer! What brings you here today?"
    ];

    owner.current_dialogue = greetings.randomElement();
    $("game").trigger_event("npc_speaks", {npc: owner, text: owner.current_dialogue});

    return {success: true, wmem: wmem};
  }
}
....

=== Custom Scripts and Styles

Extend Rez with your own JavaScript functions and CSS styling.

==== Adding Custom JavaScript

Use `@script` to add utility functions:

....
@script {
  // Dice rolling utilities
  function rollDie(sides) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
  }

  function rollDice(count, sides, modifier = 0) {
    let total = modifier;
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      total += rollDie(sides);
    }
    return total;
  }

  // Combat calculation helpers
  function calculateDamage(attacker, defender) {
    const baseDamage = rollDice(2, 6) + attacker.strength_modifier;
    const mitigatedDamage = Math.max(1, baseDamage - defender.armor_class);
    return mitigatedDamage;
  }
}
....

==== Adding Custom CSS

Use `@stylesheet` to style your game:

....
@stylesheet {
  .character-sheet {
    border: 2px solid #8B4513;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #F5E6D3, #E8D5B7);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
  }

  .health-bar {
    width: 100%;
    height: 20px;
    background-color: #444;
    border: 2px solid #000;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .health-fill {
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ff4444, #ffaa44, #44ff44);
    transition: width 0.3s ease;
  }

  .combat-actions button {
    background: #8B4513;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-size: 16px;
  }

  .combat-actions button:hover {
    background: #A0522D;
    transform: translateY(-2px);
  }

  .flash-message {
    background: #FFD700;
    border: 2px solid #FFA500;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px 0;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
}
....

==== JavaScript Patches

Extend built-in JavaScript objects with the `@patch` directive:

....
@patch {
  patch: "Array"
  method: "sample"
  impl: function(count = 1) {
    const shuffled = [...this].sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
    return count === 1 ? shuffled[0] : shuffled.slice(0, count);
  }
}

// Now you can use:
// ["red", "green", "blue"].sample()  -> "green"
// [1,2,3,4,5].sample(3)  -> [3, 1, 5]
....

==== Custom Template Filters

Create your own template expression filters:

....
@filter DICE_ROLL_FILTER {
  name: "roll"
  impl: (dice_notation) => {
    // Parse "2d6+3" format
    const match = dice_notation.match(/(\d+)d(\d+)(?:\+(\d+))?/);
    if (!match) return 0;

    const count = parseInt(match[1]);
    const sides = parseInt(match[2]);
    const modifier = parseInt(match[3]) || 0;

    return rollDice(count, sides, modifier);
  }
}

// Use in templates:
// <p>You rolled ${"2d6+3" | roll} damage!</p>
....

=== Building Modular Game Systems

For large games, organize your code into modular systems:

....
// combat_system.rez
@script {
  const CombatSystem = {
    initiateCombat(player, enemy) {
      $("game").combat_state = {
        player: player,
        enemy: enemy,
        turn: "player",
        round: 1
      };
      return RezEvent.switchScene("combat");
    },

    processTurn(action, target) {
      const state = $("game").combat_state;
      // Process combat logic...
      return this.checkCombatEnd(state);
    },

    checkCombatEnd(state) {
      if (state.player.health <= 0) {
        return RezEvent.playCard("player_defeated");
      } else if (state.enemy.health <= 0) {
        return RezEvent.playCard("enemy_defeated");
      }
      return RezEvent.render();
    }
  };
}

// inventory_system.rez
@script {
  const InventorySystem = {
    addItem(character, item) {
      if (!character.inventory) character.inventory = [];
      character.inventory.push(item);
      this.sortInventory(character);
    },

    removeItem(character, itemId) {
      if (!character.inventory) return false;
      const index = character.inventory.findIndex(item => item.id === itemId);
      if (index >= 0) {
        character.inventory.splice(index, 1);
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    },

    sortInventory(character) {
      character.inventory.sort((a, b) => {
        // Sort by type, then by name
        if (a.type !== b.type) return a.type.localeCompare(b.type);
        return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);
      });
    }
  };
}
....

==== The Compilation Process

When you run `rez compile`, several steps occur:

1. **Parse Source Files** - Rez reads your `.rez` files and parses the element definitions
2. **Validate References** - Checks that element references (like `#player`) point to existing elements
3. **Generate JavaScript** - Converts elements into JavaScript objects and classes
4. **Template Compilation** - Transforms template expressions into rendering functions
5. **Asset Processing** - Copies assets and generates asset manifests
6. **Runtime Assembly** - Combines everything into `runtime.js` and `index.html`

==== Runtime Object Model

Your Rez elements become JavaScript objects at runtime:

* `@game` → `RezGame` instance
* `@scene` → `RezScene` instance
* `@card` → `RezCard` instance
* `@actor` → `RezActor` instance
* And so on...

Each object gets methods and properties based on the attributes you defined:

....
@actor hero {
  name: "Brave Knight"
  health: 100

  heal: function(amount) {
    this.health += amount;
  }
}

// Becomes at runtime:
const hero = new RezActor({
  id: "hero",
  name: "Brave Knight",
  health: 100,
  heal: function(amount) {
    this.health += amount;
  }
});
....

==== The Rendering Pipeline

Content rendering follows this flow:

1. **Game Layout** renders with scene content in `${content}`
2. **Scene Layout** renders with card content in `${content}`
3. **Card Content** renders with template expressions resolved
4. **Blocks** (if any) render and provide additional template variables

Each level wraps the next in HTML structure:

....
<div class="game">                    <!-- Game wrapper -->
  <!-- Game layout content -->
  <div class="scene" id="scene_forest"> <!-- Scene wrapper -->
    <!-- Scene layout content -->
    <div class="card" id="card_clearing"> <!-- Card wrapper -->
      <!-- Card content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
....

==== Memory and Performance

**Global Objects**: Elements with `$global: true` become window variables:

....
@actor player {
  $global: true
  name: "Hero"
}

// Accessible as: window.$player or just $player
....

**Template Caching**: Template rendering functions are compiled once and cached for performance.

**Event Delegation**: Rez uses event delegation for clicks, so dynamically added content automatically works.

=== Complete Attribute Type Reference

==== Primitive Types

**Boolean**
....
visible: true
completed: false
enabled: yes     // yes/no also work
hidden: no
....

**Number**
....
count: 42
price: 19.99
temperature: -10
percentage: 0.85
....

**String**
....
name: "Magic Sword"
description: "A blade that glows with inner light"
note: ""  // Empty string
....

**Keyword**
....
type: :weapon
rarity: :legendary
status: :active
category: :consumable
....

==== Complex Types

**Element Reference**
....
owner_id: #player
location_id: #forest_clearing
target_id: #dragon
....

**List** (space-separated, no commas)
....
colors: [:red :green :blue]
scores: [100 250 75 420]
items: [#sword #shield #potion]
mixed: ["text" 42 :keyword #reference]
....

**Set** (unique values, unordered)
....
tags: #{:magical :rare :weapon}
visited_locations: #{#town #forest #cave}
....

**Template** (multi-line with expressions)
....
content: ```
<h2>${title}</h2>
<p>Welcome, ${player.name}!</p>
$if(player.level > 5) {%
  <p>You are an experienced adventurer.</p>
%}
```
....

**Binding List** (key-value pairs)
....
bindings: [
  player: #main_character,
  location: () => player.current_location,
  gold: &player.gold
]
....

==== Dynamic Types

**Dynamic Initializer** (runs once at game start)
....
random_stat: ^i{return Math.random() * 20 + 1;}
starting_gold: ^i:1{return rollDice(3, 6) * 10;}  // Priority 1 (runs early)
total_stats: ^i:5{return this.str + this.dex + this.int;}  // Priority 5
....

Dynamic intializers are Javascript code blocks that are run when the game is
being initialized. The result of the code block will be assigned to the value
of the attribute.

Initializers are run in priority order 1-10. By default an initializer has
priority 10. To specify a priority use `:prio` after the `^i` prefix, e.g. to
initialize an attribute at priority 5 you would write `^i:5{...}`.

**Dynamic Property** (calculated each access, see Part 2 for basics)
....
// Advanced: Complex calculations with error handling
spell_save_dc: ^p{
  const base = 8 + this.proficiency_bonus;
  const modifier = this.spell_casting_modifier || 0;
  return Math.max(8, base + modifier);
}

// Advanced: Conditional logic and multiple dependencies
movement_speed: ^p{
  let speed = this.base_speed || 30;
  if (this.is_encumbered) speed = Math.floor(speed / 2);
  if (this.hasCondition?.("haste")) speed *= 2;
  if (this.hasCondition?.("slow")) speed = Math.floor(speed / 2);
  return Math.max(0, speed);
}

// Advanced: Expensive calculations that should be cached
threat_assessment: ^p{
  // This is expensive - consider using ^i{} with manual updates instead
  const nearby = this.getAllNearbyEnemies();
  return nearby.reduce((threat, enemy) => {
    return threat + (enemy.level * enemy.aggression_factor);
  }, 0);
}
....

**Dice Notation**
....
damage: ^r:2d6+3      // Roll 2 six-sided dice, add 3
treasure: ^r:d100     // Roll 1 hundred-sided die
healing: ^r:1d4+1     // Roll 1 four-sided die, add 1
....

**Probability Table**
....
loot_type: |:common 60 :uncommon 25 :rare 10 :legendary 5|
encounter: |#goblin 40 #orc 30 #troll 20 #dragon 10|
weather: |"sunny" 50 "cloudy" 30 "rainy" 15 "stormy" 5|
....

==== Script Types

**Event Script** (arrow function, receives object and event)
....
on_use: (item, event) => {
  player.health += item.healing_power;
  return RezEvent.flash("You feel better!");
}

on_enter: (scene, event) => {
  scene.visit_count = (scene.visit_count || 0) + 1;
  return RezEvent.render();
}
....

**Action Script** (regular function, `this` is the owner object)
....
attack: function(target) {
  const damage = this.attack_power + rollDie(6);
  target.health -= damage;
  return damage;
}

canAfford: function(price) {
  return this.gold >= price;
}
....

**Behavior Tree**
....
behaviors: ^[
  $select
    [$sequence
      [health_low]
      [has_potion]
      [use_potion]]
    [$sequence
      [enemy_nearby]
      [attack_enemy]]
    [wander_around]
]
....

==== Special Attributes

**System Attributes** (control Rez behavior)
....
$global: true          // Create global variable
$template: true        // Mark as template for copying
$js_ctor: "CustomClass" // Use different JavaScript constructor
$built_in: true        // Mark as built-in (documentation only)
....

**ID Suffix Attributes** (create automatic references)
....
owner_id: #player          // Also creates 'owner' property pointing to player object
location_id: #forest      // Also creates 'location' property pointing to forest object
target_id: #dragon        // Also creates 'target' property pointing to dragon object
initial_card_id: #start   // Also creates 'initial_card' property pointing to start card
initial_scene_id: #main   // Also creates 'initial_scene' property pointing to main scene
parent_id: #container     // Also creates 'parent' property pointing to container object
....

=== Best Practices and Patterns

==== Project Organization

Structure larger projects with clear separation:

....
src/
├── game.rez              # Main game definition
├── characters/
│   ├── player.rez        # Player character
│   ├── npcs.rez          # Non-player characters
│   └── monsters.rez      # Enemy creatures
├── locations/
│   ├── town.rez          # Town scenes and cards
│   ├── dungeon.rez       # Dungeon areas
│   └── overworld.rez     # World map
├── items/
│   ├── weapons.rez       # Weapon definitions
│   ├── armor.rez         # Armor and protection
│   └── consumables.rez   # Potions, scrolls, etc.
└── systems/
    ├── combat.rez        # Combat mechanics
    ├── inventory.rez     # Inventory management
    └── dialogue.rez      # Conversation system
....

Use the include macro to combine files:
....
// In game.rez
@game {
  name: "My Adventure"
  // ... game definition
}

%(characters/player.rez)
%(characters/npcs.rez)
%(locations/town.rez)
%(items/weapons.rez)
%(systems/combat.rez)
....

==== Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming patterns:

....
// Scenes: describe location or context
@scene forest_entrance
@scene combat_arena
@scene character_creation

// Cards: describe content or action
@card explore_clearing
@card merchant_dialogue
@card level_up_screen

// Actors: role or name
@actor village_guard
@actor evil_wizard
@actor shop_keeper

// Items: descriptive names
@item rusty_sword
@item healing_potion
@item magic_amulet
....

==== State Management

Keep game state organized and predictable:

....
@game {
  name: "Adventure Game"

  // Global game state
  current_chapter: 1
  player_score: 0
  game_flags: {}

  // Helper methods for state
  setFlag: function(name, value = true) {
    this.game_flags[name] = value;
  }

  getFlag: function(name) {
    return this.game_flags[name] || false;
  }

  addScore: function(points) {
    this.player_score += points;
    if (this.player_score >= 1000) {
      this.setFlag("high_score_achieved");
    }
  }
}
....

==== Error Handling

Handle edge cases gracefully:

....
@card examine_item {
  bindings: [
    target_item: () => {
      const itemId = $("game").selected_item_id;
      return itemId ? $(itemId) : null;
    }
  ]
  content: ```
  $if(target_item) {%
    <h3>${target_item.name}</h3>
    <p>${target_item.description}</p>
    <button event="use_item">Use Item</button>
  %}, {%
    <p>No item selected to examine.</p>
    <button card="inventory">Back to Inventory</button>
  %}
  ```
}
....

==== Performance Tips

1. **Use Global Sparingly**: Only mark frequently-accessed objects as global
2. **Optimize Templates**: Avoid complex calculations in template expressions
3. **Choose the Right Dynamic Type**: Match the attribute type to your use case
4. **Cache Expensive Operations**: Store calculated values rather than recalculating
5. **Batch DOM Updates**: Use `{render: true}` to refresh all content at once

**Choosing Between Dynamic Types**:

....
// Use ^p{} for values that change frequently and need to be current
health_percentage: ^p{return this.health * 100 / this.max_health;}

// Use ^i{} for complex setup that rarely changes
starting_equipment: ^i{
  return this.character_class === "warrior"
    ? ["sword", "shield", "armor"]
    : ["dagger", "lockpicks", "cloak"];
}

// Use regular attributes for values that change manually
experience: 0  // Updated by events, not calculated

// Use ^i{} with manual updates for expensive calculations
threat_level: ^i{return this.calculateThreatLevel();}
recalculate_threat: function() {
  this.threat_level = this.calculateThreatLevel();
}
....

**Template Optimization**:

....
// Good: use dynamic properties to move calculations out of templates
@actor player {
  base_attack: 10
  strength: 15
  attack_power: ^p{return this.base_attack + Math.floor(this.strength / 2);}
}

content: ```
Attack Power: ${player.attack_power}
```

// Less good: calculate every time template renders
content: ```
Attack Power: ${player.base_attack + Math.floor(player.strength / 2)}
```
....
