= REZ: Cookbook

The following is a guide to some of Rez's features and common things you may want to be able to do.

== Using `@object`

Rez defines a number of generally useful elements like `@actor`, `@item`, `@inventory`, `@scene` and so forth. These elements have built-in behaviours designed to be useful but flexible.

For example `@item` and `@inventory` can be used to define much more than physical objects. You could have an inventory representing things different actors know about and use an item for individual topics/thoughts. Or items could represent spells in an inventory spell-book. The `@item`/`@inventory` elements are flexible enough to cover a range of container/containment situations.

However, there are going to be a range of concepts in a game for which Rez cannot plan or which may require very customised behaviour. A good example is that of "classes" as in RPG classes. There are so many possible ways to have a class work in a game that Rez cannot really offer a useful starting point. For this type of situation there is `@object`.

The `@object` element allows you to create a fully-custom object that has no built-in behaviours (beyond what you get from the `__basic_object__` runtime prototype that all in-game objects share).

Let's look at an example:

....
@object soldier begin
  specialisation: :combat
  perks: #{#two_weapon_style #pounce #shield_bash #second_wind}
end

@object two_weapon_style begin
  level: 3
  label: "Fight with two weapons almost as well as one"
end

@object pounce begin
  level: 5
  label: "Close distance to an enemy and engage them quicker"
end

@object shield_bash begin
  level: 7
  label: "Shields can be a weapon in the right hands"
end

@object second_wind begin
  level: 9
  label: "When the chips are down, you come out fighting"
end

@object wizard begin
  specialisation: :magic
  perks: #{#fast_cast #mana_surge #concentration #max_damage}
end

@object fast_cast begin
  level: 3
  label: "Faster than a speeding magic missile"
end

@object mana_surge begin
  level: 5
  label: "You can always reach down for just one more spell"
end

@object concentration begin
  level: 7
  label: "Nothing can distract you"
end

@object max_damage begin
  level: 9
  label: "Your fireballs are the crispiest"
end

@actor thaugrim_the_wise begin
  %% Code dealing with this actor can lookup available perks from
  %% the Wizards class object
  class: #wizard
end
....

How an author chooses to use these elements in their game is up to them, there are many ways that class membership & perks could be applied to in-game situations. You'd write callbacks or behaviour tasks that make use of them. These elements can be referenced by `$(<id>)`, the same as other elements and implement the `__basic_object__` abstraction.

== Avoiding Duplication with Aliases

A common scenario is a number of scenes wanting to share the same layout. While it is possible to supply the same `layout:` attribute and duplicate the content Rez does offer a better way: aliases.

An alias has a name, element type, and one or more objects to base instances of the alias upon. These objects will define the default attributes.

....
@item magic_item_template begin
  magical: true
end

@alias magic_item = item<magic_item_template>

@magic_item magic_ring begin
  description: "A plain golden band. Probably nobody is interested in this ring at all."
end
....

Another example might be wanting to specify a common layout for a group of scenes:

....
@scene standard_scene begin
  layout_format: :markdown
  layout: ```${content}```
end

@alias standard_scene = scene<standard_scene>

@standard_scene scene_01 begin
  %% scene specific content here
end
....

== Multiple elements sharing a unique random value

In some circumstances you want multiple elements to have an attribute that shares the same random value. This is easily achieved using an extra object and attribute refs. Here is an example:

....
@object holds_random_value begin
  %% this will be assigned a random value when the game is initialized
  rand: &{Math.rand_int(1, 10)}
end

@actor player begin
  %% this will refer to the value from the object
  rand: &hold_random_value.rand
end

@actor npc begin
  %% as will this
  rand: &hold_random_value.rand
end
....

Note that you can change the value but only in the object that holds it.

== Using Decisions

`RezDecision` is an object that doesn't have an element. You create them when you want code (or perhaps users) to make a yes/no decision.

You can use a decision like this:

....
const decision = new RezDecision("Include Adult themes", {info: "Toggle this on to include themes of sex & violence that might not be suitable for all. Leave it off for a family friendly experience."});
decision.default_no();
some_function_making_the_decision(decision);
if(decision.result) {
  // do something
} else {
  // do something else
}
....

In this case the `some_function_making_the_decision(decision)` is expected to call either `decision.yes()` or `decision.no("reason")` before returning. In most cases you will be passing a decision to a script. In this case if neither function gets called the decision will default to 'no' (`false`). If we had used `decision.default_yes()` it would work the other way around.

You can pass data into a decision either through the second argument to `new RezDecision()` or using the `setData(key, value)` API. After receiving a decision you can use the `data()` API to retrieve data. This way the callee can pass other information back with the decision.

== Linking to things

The current scene will render its card which can include links to render other cards and other scenes. This is done by specifying either a card or scene id in a link.

If the id is of a card then the new card will be rendered as part of the layout of the existing scene. Depending on the scenes layout mode it will either replace the content of the previous card, or be appended to it.

If the id is of a scene then a transition to the new scene will be started.

== Static Links

A static link is always embedded and points directly at a card or scene. It is equivalent to a Twine passage link and has the same syntax as follows:

....
[[Main Street]]
....

This will embed a link to load a card with the id `main_street` and is syntactic sugar for writing:

....
[[Main Street|main_street]]
....

If no id is included the link text is converted into lower case and spacres are replaced with underscores, so "Main Street" becomes "main_street".

== Dynamic Links

Sometimes you want more control over whether links are displayed at all, can be clicked, and what text they present. For example an option may be disabled with a message that informs the player why they can't take that action at present. Or hidden because it doesn't make sense yet.

Rez supports dynamic links that give you this level of control. For example if you write:

....
[[*main_street]]
....

Rez will look for a `main_street` script attribute of the card and will call that script to determine whether a link should be displayed, what the text of the link should be, and whether the player can click it or not, and even what happens when they do.

The options are:

* **allow** which will display the link and point to the id of a card or scene to load if the player clicks it.
* **deny** which will present the link text but disable the link so that it cannot be selected.
* **hide** which will return empty text so that no link is presented at all

Example

....
@card side_street begin
  main_street: (choice) => {
    if choice.game.is("dark") {
      choice.deny("You can't see a thing, maybe use your flashlight or a match.");
    } else {
      choice.allow("Head to Main st.", "main_street");
    }
  }
end
....

You can also take over what happens when a link is clicked:

....
@card side_street begin
  on_main_street: (game, evt) => {
    // do what you want here
  }
end
....

== Forms and Inputs

Rez has built in support for forms and inputs that is enabled by adding `rez-live` to the `<form>` or `<input>` tag. For example to process a form when it is submitted:

  <form name="foo" rez-live>
    …
  </form>

When this form is submitted a handler `on_foo` will be invoked on the `Card` that contains the form.

Alternatively if you just want an input that is "live" you can use:

<input id="…" rez-live … />

Whenever the input generates an event (e.g. the user changes the value of the field) a corresponding handler will be called on the enclosing Card:

....
on_input: (game, evt) => {
  // do something with evt.input
}
....

The potential uses for this are endless but typically you will either be updating a stored value or triggering a new scene/interlude.

== Switching Scenes

There are two ways to change the scene:

A scene switch is where we move from one scene to another as part of the narrative flow of the game.

A scene interlude is where we suspend the current scene and temporarily switch to another scene before resuming the original scene. Scenes are held in a stack so we can also interlude from an interlude but always with the ability to backtrack to the original scene.

Rez provides three filters to create these links, `scene_switch`, `scene_interlude`, and `scene_resume`:

....
${card | scene_shift: <scene-id>, 'Title'}
${card | scene_interlude: <scene-id>, 'Title'}
${card | scene_resume: 'Title'}
....

with the respective shorthand syntaxes:

....
[[Title|>scene_id]] # Switches to a new scene
[[Title|!scene_id]] # Creates an interlude to the new scene
....

Alternatively you can use Scene API to resume after an iterlude.

== Asset Management

Rez has built in support for assets including images, sounds, and movie files.
You specify the assets you want to use in your source file.

....
@asset frobzz_1 begin
  tags: #[:background]
  file_name: "scary_dungeon.jpg"
end
....

Rez will automatically copy asset files into the games distribution folder.

Rez provides a filter to generate references to the asset file in the distribution folder:

....
${asset_id | asset_path}
${asset_id | asset_tag}
....

to generate appropriate markup to embed the asset into the game. Rez assets auto-detect the MIME type of the asset file and generate the appropriate HTML tag for the asset.

== Procedural Generation

Rez was designed at the outset to support procedural generation of content.

CAUTION: This content is out of date and the APIs and processes have changed.

=== Creating copies

Rez supports the idea that you will create 'template' elements that are designed to be copied, you do this by applying the `template`` attribute to it.

....
@actor basic_npc begin
  $template: true
end
....

This enables the use of the `copyAssigningId()` and `copyWithAutoId()` API functions to make copies.

Then specify attributes that should initialised in the copy when it is created by using refs.

    name: &name_gen
    name_gen: () => {function returning a name}

All ref-based attributes are assigned their values when a template is copied.

There is a special behaviour that when a ref references an attribute which is either a die roll or a function that the attribute is evaluated, i.e. the function is called or the dice rolled and the resulting value is assigned to the referring attribute. Hence:

    skill_roll: 3d6
    skill: &skill_roll

When the object is copied the `skill_roll` will be made (e.g. 3d6 = 13) and the value 13 will be assigned to the attribute `skill`.
